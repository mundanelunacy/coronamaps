# coronamaps

My name is Toshi and I created Coronamaps.org

The goal is to have a website where people can type in their location to bring up hot spots where confirmed Corona Virus cases had visited prior to quarintine

A universally accessible database with the power to inform you if you've been in contact with active Corona cases could be the difference between life and death ...
maybe not for you but for someone you know

-   If you are Corona Case I urge you to click on the "Submit Case" button and you'll be given instructions on how to input your information. Don't worry. Privacy and Anonymyty will be enforced
-   If you are a developer, the code is open source so please, consider volunteering your time
-   If you are a government or public health official please reach out to me using the information below. I'd like to work with you and coordinate the aggregation and dissemination of this vital information, faster and easier
-   For everyone else, please consider donating.

I will not take a dime for the work I'm putting into this. All the money will go toward paying off server fees and operations.
