# Coronamaps.org

### Under Development

A prototype of the site can be found here:
https://coronamaps-9e44a.firebaseapp.com/lp

[Coronamaps.org](https://coronamaps.org) is a crowdsourced website where people can type in an address to bring up locations where COVID-19 cases had visited prior to quarintine. It aims to create a universally accessible database which give users the ability to check if they have been exposed.

-   If you are Corona Case I urge you to click on the ["Submit Case" button](https://coronamaps.org/submit) where you'll be given instructions on how to input your information. Don't worry. [Privacy and anonymity are enforced](https://coronamaps.org/privacy)
-   If you are a developer, the code is [open source](https://github.com/mundanelunacy/coronamaps) so please, consider contributing
-   If you are a government or public health official please [reach out to me](https://coronamaps.org/official) to discuss how this tool can be used to help you in your area
-   For everyone else, please consider [donating](https://paypal.com). All the money will go toward paying server fees and operations (I will not take a dime)

This is a call to arms for anyone who feels powerless and alone. Only by working together, will we overcome.
