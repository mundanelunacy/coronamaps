# Coronamaps.org

[Coronamaps.org](https://coronamaps.org) is a crowdsourced website where people can type in an address to bring up locations where confirmed COVID-19 cases had visited prior to quarintine

We aim to create a universally accessible database which give users the ability to check if they have been exposed to an active Corona case.

-   If you are Corona Case I urge you to click on the ["Submit Case" button](https://coronamaps.org/submit) and you'll be given instructions on how to input your information. Don't worry. [Privacy and anonymity will be enforced](https://coronamaps.org/privacy)
-   If you are a developer, the code is [open source](https://github.com/mundanelunacy/coronamaps) so please, consider contributing
-   If you are a government or public health official please [reach out to me](https://coronamaps.org/official) to discuss how this tool can be used to help you in your area
-   For everyone else, please consider [donating](https://paypal.com). All the money will go toward paying off server fees and operations (I will not take a dime)

This is a call to arms for anyone who feels powerless against the exponentiating foe. Together we fight
